	"description" : "A continuation of part one, <i>mother / me (II)</i>, developed and brought to fruition collaboratively with my mother, is a visual and psychological inquiry into queer representation and mothering in the American South. <i>mother / me (II)</i> aimed to fuse the mediums of photography and video while utilizing innovative storytelling methods to convey artful and highly constructed personas played by my mother and myself. After designing the aesthetic and sentiment of each image, we staged each scene. Then, I lit, directed, and produced each individual image, which is shown as a 4K movie. <i>mother / me (II)</i> is a meditation on love and beauty, life and death.",
