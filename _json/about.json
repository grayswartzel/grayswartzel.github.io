	"description" : "My name is Gray, just like the color! I am an art director passionate about creative visual communication. With an MFA from Carnegie Mellon University and a BFA from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, my formal training as an artist and over eight years of experience in art direction compliment my innate eye for detail. Like any great work of art, an ad campaign has the capacity to tell many stories, but it must elicit a visceral response, one that both captivates and stimulates the potential consumer. A brand identity must be constructed so that the outwardly performed visual identity is true to the brand’s heart and soul. As a queer artist, I task myself with the challenge of keeping a finger on the pulse of visual culture, helping me to think innovatively and produce work that resonates in the here and now. Let’s collaborate and bring something thoughtfully beautiful to light.",
