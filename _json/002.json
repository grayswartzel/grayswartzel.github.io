	"description" : "<i>mother / me (I)</i>, developed and brought to fruition collaboratively with my mother, is a visual and psychological inquiry into queer representation and mothering in the American South. <i>mother / me (I)</i> aimed to fuse the mediums of photography and video while employing innovative storytelling methods to convey artful and highly constructed personas played by my mother and myself. After designing the aesthetic sentiment of each image, we staged each scene. Then, I lit, directed, and produced each individual image, which is shown as a 4K movie. <i>mother / me (I)</i> is a meditation on love and beauty, life and death.",
