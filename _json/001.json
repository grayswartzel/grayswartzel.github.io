	"description" : "As part of the Griffin Farleyâ€™s Beautiful Minds program at BBH New York, invited participants were given a crash course in creative planning. Then, in small groups, we addressed a brief for The Get In Touch Foundation, which promotes free education for proper breast self-exams. Their goal was to achieve 500k unique downloads for The Daisy Wheel app within the first year as well as raise awareness for the Get In Touch brand among a new generation of young adults. Together, our team decided to target a population we named Nevaeh, or Gen Z women and trans men aged 16-20 who are starting to step into control of their own health. We found the problem to be that the breast cancer debate is focussed on awareness, but awareness does not equate to action. We focused on brand partnerships that would help reinforce \"Make Pink Mean Action,\" fueling self-exams, app downloads, and brand awareness!",
