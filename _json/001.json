Then, in small groups, we addressed a brief for <a href='https://getintouchfoundation.org/' target='_blank'>The Get In Touch Foundation</a>, which promotes free education for proper breast self-exams. Their goal was to achieve 500k unique downloads for <a href='https://apps.apple.com/us/app/daisy-wheel/id1461447061' target='_blank'>The Daisy Wheel</a> app within the first year as well as raise awareness for the Get In Touch brand among a new generation of young adults. Together, our team decided to target a population we named Nevaeh, or Gen Z women and trans men aged 16-20 who are starting to step into control of their own health. We found the problem to be that the breast cancer debate is focussed on awareness, but awareness does not equate to action. We focused on brand partnerships and public activations that would help reinforce \"Make Pink Mean Action,\" fueling self-exams, app downloads, and brand awareness.\n\n∿\n\nCollaboration with Kylie Boyd, Nthabi Kamala, Joshua Tjahjadi",
